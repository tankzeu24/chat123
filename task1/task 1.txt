make a  class called ElectricDevice ,which is an electrical device and stores data about its name(symbolic array in the dynamic memory) and consumed
power in kW(whole number).Make a class called ElectricNet , which describes an electric network with given maximum consumption of electricity.
Make the following operators:

+ and += with an argument ElectricDevice,which adds a device to a network,if it won't overload ( the total consumption of the energy of all devices
plugged in it won't be greater than the maximum  consumation of the network)

- and -= with an argument ElectricDevice , which removes  a device from the network,if that device is plugged into this network.Devices are recognized
by their name.

[] with an argument symbolic array,which gives the opportunity to access certain device,plugged into that network.

! ,which checks if there is a deviced plugged into the network.

++, which doubles the maximumum consumption of energy in that network.

-- , which halves the maximum consumption of energy in the network,if it won't overload after this operation
