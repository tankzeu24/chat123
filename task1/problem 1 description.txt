5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) - 3
Can be written using reverse polish notation  as
5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 
Make a calculator that computes reverse polish notation  working with doubles and ints , by doing this :

1.create Stack class that works with doubles and ints

2.create class Calculator with function calculate that accepts char* with maximum size 100 symbols
which accepts reverse polish notation using the operators са +, -, *, / и % (can be used only on ints). 
The function computes the reverse polish notation and returns a number
