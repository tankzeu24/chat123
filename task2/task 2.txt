a) make a template class Pair with  a parameter T,which has properties- "key"  of type array of symbols and "value" of type T.Make the
methods from the big 4 and methods getKey, getValue and setValue

b) make template class Settings with a parameter T,which is a list of pairs , where each one is from class Pair.Make:

- methods from the big 4
- method "count" ,which returns the number of elements in the list
 - method "set" with 2 parameters : "key" ( its type is symbolic array) ,and "value"( its type is T).In case  the container does not contain a pair with 
the passed "key" from the method "set" then a new pair with the passed "key" and "value" should be added to the list . If there is a pair
in the list with  key equal to the parameter  "key" ,then this pair's "value"  must be replaced with the parameter "value" passed
-method get with 2 parameters -  key ( its type is symbolic  array) ,and value( its type is T &).The method checks  if in the list contains
a pair with key equals to the parameter passed "key" and if there is - it changes the passed parameter "value" to the value of the pair
 and returns true .Otherwise , it returns false.
c) make in the main method tests
